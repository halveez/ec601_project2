# ec601_project2

Phase 1a - I defined three test programs in project2.py:

print_user_tweets() to print a subset of tweets by a specified user.
print_current_comments() to print a recently selected set of tweets given by search string.
get_trends_by_location() to print a list of trends by WOEID location.

get_trends_by_location() can be improved through the use of a Yahoo API look-up search for WOEID locations given the name of the location as WOEID's are not commonly known

Phase 1b
Write test programs to exercise different Google NLP APIs.  Focus on Sentiment analysis.
All your programs should be on GitHub including a README file explaining your tests and results.

Error conditions
What happens if twitter is not responding
What happens if I pass the wrong handle
What happens if Google NLP API does not respond back
Data back and forth
What do I send?
What do I get?
What is the format of the data?
How can I use such data?

Phase 2:  Build your own social media analyzer
Define MVP and user stories
Translate user stories to a modular design
Who is your user?
What are the basic user stories?
